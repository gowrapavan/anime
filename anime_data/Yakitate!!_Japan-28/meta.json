And being blessed with unusually warm hands that allow dough to ferment faster, Azuma is able to bring his baking innovations to another level.\n\nAs he begins working at the prestigious Japanese bakery chain, Pantasia, Azuma encounters other talented bakers and experiences firsthand the competitive world of baking.
